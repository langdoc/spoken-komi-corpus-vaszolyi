# Spoken Komi Corpus: Erik Vászolyi

This is a portion of the Spoken Komi Corpus that contains recordings done by Erik Vászolyi in Komi Republic at 1950s and 1960s. The recordings have been archived in several institutions, and the goal of this work is to connect different transcription versions and digitized files to one another in an openly accessible database. 

In our reference system we use the recording signums that are used in the [Tape Archive of the Finnish Language](https://www.kotus.fi/en/corpora_and_other_material/spoken_language_corpora) located at the [Institute for the Languages of Finland](https://www.kotus.fi/en).

The work is done within Kone Foundation funded project [Language Documentation meets Language Technology: The Next Step in the Description of Komi](http://langdoc.github.io/IKDP-2). 

Authors: Rogier Blokland, Niko Partanen and Michael Rießler.
